GitHub is a cloud-based platform where developers can store, manage, and collaborate on their code projects. Think of it as Google Docs, but for software development.

It uses a version control system called Git. "Version control" means it tracks every single change made to the code, who made it, and when. This allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time without overwriting each other's work.

Key Features & Uses
Repositories (Repos): This is the main "project folder" where all your code and files are stored. Repositories can be public (for open-source projects) or private (for personal or company projects).

Branching & Merging: This is the core of collaboration. You can create a "branch," which is like making a copy of the project to safely test new features or fix bugs without affecting the main "master" or "main" branch. Once the changes are approved, you "merge" your branch back into the main project.

Pull Requests (PRs): This is how you propose your changes. When you finish your work on a branch, you open a "pull request". This lets other team members review your code, leave comments, and approve it before it's merged into the main project.

Collaboration: GitHub is fundamentally a social network for developers. You can follow other users, "fork" (copy) their public projects to your own account, and contribute to open-source software.

Project Management: It includes tools like Issues (to track bugs and tasks), project boards (like Trello or Kanban boards), and wikis for documentation.

Developer Portfolio: For students and professionals, your GitHub profile acts as a modern resume, showcasing your projects, skills, and contributions to other projects.
